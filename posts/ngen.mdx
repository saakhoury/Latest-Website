Personal Project: 
- Engineered and trained a self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) for a recommender system, which analyzed data from Salesforce CRM, project databases, and user feedback from an SOP feedback portal I also developed. This involved key processes such as message computation, aggregation, update, and pooling. The GNN was trained using a standard approach, with specific setups for both node and graph classification tasks. Implemented advanced training using SGD, SGDM, and ADAM optimizers, and integrated real-time model inferencing to adapt to evolving stakeholder needs. The system utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for advanced text processing, including text cleaning and Word2Vec embedding generation from scratch, and Employed advanced techniques such as FP-Growth for efficient pattern discovery, LSTM for analyzing sequential stakeholder interaction patterns, and Neural Collaborative Filtering for enhancing recommendation accuracy, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement This implementation resulted in a 20% increase in user engagement by delivering highly accurate, personalized recommendations, closely aligned with company objectives.

- Designed and deployed an advanced ELT pipeline for extracting Salesforce data using Snowflake, Bulk API 1.0, and Apache Airflow. streamlining the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of CRM data. This framework increased data accuracy by 30% and reduced data retrieval times by 40%. Developed a reconciliation framework to integrate within an advanced ELT pipeline for Salesforce data. This framework included automated data consistency checks to compare source and destination datasets, error detection and handling mechanisms to log and resolve discrepancies, and validation rules to ensure data quality. Implemented audit trails for transparency and traceability, which facilitated a 35% improvement in NGEN workflow efficiency by maintaining high data accuracy and reducing retrieval times. MongoDB was utilized for scalable data storage, seamlessly integrating into model training workflows. This approach led to a 35% improvement in NGEN workflow efficiency, a 30% increase in data accuracy, and a 40% reduction in retrieval times, significantly enhancing operational effectiveness.”

- Developed an SEO optimization strategy that led to the creation of a cutting-edge AI Summarizer and Keyword Identification Tool: This tool utilized OpenAI's embedding models and GPT API to condense large volumes of project data into actionable insights, reducing project analysis time by 50% and enabling faster, more informed decision-making. The embedding models were crucial for identifying relevant keywords by analyzing the semantic similarity of terms and phrases within the data. Sentence Transformers enhanced this process by generating dense vector representations that capture the meaning of words in context, allowing for more precise keyword extraction and ensuring that the identified keywords were contextually relevant. This advanced approach significantly improved SEO performance and optimized content strategy.

- Utilized Selenium to automate the execution of scripts that queried the chatbot, systematically gathering data to support the "AI Use Cases in Advanced Manufacturing" report. The system included an LLM chatbot testing tool that employed advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, such as metadata filtering, reranking, and query rewriting, to enhance chatbot performance and accuracy. Integrated Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis to analyze and optimize chatbot transcripts, identifying execution patterns and improving response handling. This holistic approach ensured thorough testing and data collection, which was pivotal for generating the report submitted to ISED Canada and the NGen Board.

- Developed and deployed comprehensive dashboards and interactive maps that integrated data from multiple sources. Notably, created a detailed map to visualize Member of Parliament (MP) riding relations to project investments and cluster initiatives across Canada. This map enabled stakeholders to see how project investments and cluster activities aligned with different MP ridings, providing critical insights for strategic decision-making. The overall initiative supported over 200 active users, leading to a 35% increase in user engagement and a 20% boost in data-driven project funding decisions by translating complex data into actionable visualizations and insights.


- Governance Report and Data Analysis: Gathered and analyzed data on 50 Canadian federal funding programs, focusing on key metrics such as economic impact, environmental benefits, innovation, and social impact. Utilized advanced Excel features (such as pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and data validation) and SharePoint for data management to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the analysis. This approach identified gaps in reporting and informed the development of improved metrics for NGen’s own reporting, leading to enhanced transparency and accountability.

- Leveraged insights from comprehensive research on advanced manufacturing techniques, including Prefabricated, Modular, and Mass Timber Homebuilding, conducted in collaboration with academic institutions: Developed a proof of concept by integrating these findings into an AI model designed to predict housing trends and assess the impact of innovative construction methods. Employed Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Linear Regression models to analyze diverse data sources, including economic indicators, demographic data, and housing metrics. Utilized Matplotlib for visualization to provide actionable insights for strategic investments. This analysis provided actionable insights for strategic investments. This proof of concept demonstrated how AI agents can calculate housing indexes, guiding investment decisions for NGen’s Homebuilding initiative and supporting informed decision-making for future funding initiatives.


- Conducted industry analysis at MMTS 2024, engaging with over 100 organizations to assess NGen’s brand awareness and market presence: This comprehensive market research involved evaluating competitor positioning, market trends, and stakeholder perceptions. Key data opportunities were identified, including potential growth areas and emerging trends. Established new outreach foundations and strategic partnerships, enabling NGen to leverage these insights for enhanced external engagement and improved market presence. This analysis also provided actionable recommendations for refining marketing strategies, optimizing resource allocation, and boosting brand visibility within the industry.
